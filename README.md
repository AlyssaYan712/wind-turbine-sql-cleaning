# SQL Cleaning Scripts: Wind Turbine & EIA Operators

This repository contains data cleaning queries for two datasets:

- `wind_turbine_20220114`: Cleaned location, manufacturer, numeric and date fields.
- `clean_eia923_operators`: Cleaned operator names, plant state, and net generation fields.

These queries were used in a wind energy data project to prepare datasets for visualization and modeling.
